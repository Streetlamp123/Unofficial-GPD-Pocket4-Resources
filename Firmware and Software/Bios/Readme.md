# Bios

> [!CAUTION]
> Double check you have the correct file for your processor before flashing

These files were downloaded from GPD's website and uploaded here for archival and easy-of-access purposes.  
This was done in good faith but GPD does not release checksums for you or I to verify against.  
As always, be careful when downloading and flashing software from 3rd party sources.

> [!TIP]
> Pressing ALT+F5 while in the bios will unhide some hidden settings.  
> Remember to reboot your device after pressing to have them show up
