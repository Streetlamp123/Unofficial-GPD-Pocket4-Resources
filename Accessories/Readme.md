> I got a Three One anti-reflective screen protector as a gift with my Pocket 4. 
It is matte, has a camera notch, and doesn't produce any rainbowing.
(I am in Japan, sorry if it's not available where you are)

> [!WARNING]
> Fits but the camera notch will be wrong

I've used this personally. It looks great but you'll have to live with the camera notch being in the wrong possition

## Thermals
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Re-doing thermal paste should not void your warranty as long as you don't break anything*

According to [u/kendyzhu on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/kendyzhu/), re-doing the thermal paste won't void your warranty as long as you don't break anything.
